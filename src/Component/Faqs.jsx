                <p>
                  Yes, when applied by a skilled lash artist using proper
                  techniques, lash extensions are safe and do not harm your
                  natural lashes. It's essential to follow aftercare
                  instructions for optimal lash health.

                  Lash extensions generally last through a full growth cycle of
                  natural lashes, which is about 6 to 8 weeks. However, regular
                  touch-ups every 2 to 4 weeks are recommended to maintain a
                  full and lush look.

                Can I wear mascara with lash extensions?

              <div className="collapse-content">
                <p>
                  While mascara is not necessary with lash extensions, you can
                  use a water-based, extension-safe mascara if desired. Avoid
                  oil-based or waterproof mascaras, as they can compromise the
                  adhesive and shorten the lifespan of your extensions.

                <p>
                  Use a lash extension-safe cleanser and a gentle brush to clean
                  your lashes daily. Avoid rubbing or pulling on the lashes, and
                  refrain from using oil-based products around the eye area.
                  Follow the aftercare guidelines provided by your lash artist.

                <p>
                  Yes, you can swim and shower with lash extensions, but it's
                  advisable to avoid excessive exposure to water, especially in
                  the first 24 hours after application. Gently pat your lashes
                  dry after getting wet and avoid rubbing or pulling on them.

                  It's recommended to get lash extensions refilled every 2 to 4
                  weeks to maintain a full and beautiful look. Regular refills
                  help replace any shed natural lashes and keep your extensions
